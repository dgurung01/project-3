  "description": "project 3 by Indima, Connolly, Pete and Dev Here is our 3rd project not together but for class. We have decided to optimize parenting and making a fool proof way to make sure everyone is on the same page and alerted for their tasks. This mothers little helper or absentminded dads reminder is a calender of events for every member of the family where a parent can be assigned to the tasks. Once a parent is assigned they are alerted and it is added to the calander. Once the day approaches there will be a reminder in the morning and one as the time of the task nears. there will also be a to do/ chore list. each chore for the children can be valuved monetarily for allowances and keep a running total so every one is even.",
